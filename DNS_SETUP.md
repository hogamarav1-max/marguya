# DNS Setup Guide for babachecker.com → Railway

## Step 1: Deploy to Railway First

Before configuring DNS, you MUST deploy your app to Railway:

1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Create new project from GitHub: `Dipendr98/new_modern_bot`
3. Add MySQL database
4. Configure environment variables
5. Wait for deployment to complete

**You'll get a Railway URL like**: `your-app-xyz123.up.railway.app`

## Step 2: Add Custom Domain in Railway

1. In Railway, go to your **App Service**
2. Click **Settings** → **Domains**
3. Click **"+ Custom Domain"**
4. Enter: `babachecker.com`
5. Railway will show you the **CNAME target** (something like: `your-app.up.railway.app`)

## Step 3: Configure DNS in Landingsite

Based on your screenshot, here's what to do:

### For Root Domain (babachecker.com):

**Current A Record:**
- Type: `A`
- Name: `babachecker.com`
- Value: `76.76.21.21`
- **Action**: Click **"Remove"** (delete this record)

**Add New A Record** (if Railway provides an IP):
- Type: `A`
- Name: `@` or leave blank
- Value: `[Railway's IP address]`
- TTL: `3600`

**OR Add CNAME** (if Railway provides CNAME):
- Type: `CNAME`
- Name: `@`
- Points To: `your-app.up.railway.app` (from Railway)
- TTL: `3600`

### For WWW Subdomain:

**Current CNAME:**
- Type: `CNAME`
- Name: `www`
- Points To: (empty in screenshot)
